## Chapter 1: Pre-Processing

### Description

In this chapter, we focus on the **essential preprocessing steps** required to clean and prepare data for machine learning models. Proper preprocessing ensures that your dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for model training, which can significantly impact performance.

The chapter covers the following key steps:

### Key Steps:
1. **Parsing**: 
    - Reading and extracting relevant data from raw files, such as BVH files, and handling different formats.
    
2. **Data Interpolation/Resizing**:
    - Filling in missing data points by interpolating values between known data points, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.
    
3. **Denoising**:
    - Removing noise or outliers from the dataset to improve model accuracy and reduce errors.

4. **Handling NaNs (Missing Values)**:
    - Detecting and imputing missing values using various techniques (e.g., mean, median, or KNN imputation).

5. **Normalization**:
    - Scaling features to a specific range (typically [0, 1]) to ensure consistent input values for machine learning models.

6. **Standardization**:
    - Transforming features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is crucial for algorithms like SVM and neural networks.

### Importance of Pre-Processing:

- **Improves Model Performance**: Clean and structured data leads to more accurate predictions and better generalization in machine learning models.
- **Handles Missing Data**: Properly imputing or interpolating missing data ensures the integrity of the dataset and prevents model bias.
- **Reduces Noise**: Denoising helps remove irrelevant or erroneous data points, leading to better learning during training.
- **Enables Fair Feature Comparisons**: Normalization and standardization ensure that features with different scales (e.g., height in meters, weight in kilograms) are comparable, preventing certain features from dominating the model.


## Chapter 2: Mid-Level Processing

### Description

This chapter focuses on **mid-level processing** techniques, which are applied after data has been pre-processed. These techniques further refine the data, extract meaningful features, and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, allowing machine learning models to train more efficiently and accurately.

Mid-level processing includes the following steps:

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Augmentation**:
    - Enhance the size and diversity of your dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, scaling, and more. Data augmentation is especially useful in scenarios where data is limited.
    
2. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Extract meaningful features from raw data to improve the representational power of your models. This includes techniques such as calculating velocity, acceleration, and range of motion for time-series data.
    
3. **Feature Selection**:
    - Identify and retain the most relevant features using methods such as `SelectKBest` and chi-squared tests. Reducing the number of irrelevant or redundant features enhances model performance and reduces overfitting.
    
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
    - Reduce the number of features or variables in your dataset while retaining important information. Techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** or **t-SNE** help visualize high-dimensional data and speed up the model training process.
    
5. **Multi-Modal Fusion**:
    - Combine data from different sources (e.g., combining video, motion, and physiological data) to enhance model robustness and accuracy. Multi-modal fusion can be performed in both early and late stages of processing.

### Importance of Mid-Level Processing:

- **Improves Model Accuracy**: Feature extraction and selection ensure that models focus on the most important aspects of the data.
- **Prevents Overfitting**: By reducing dimensionality, mid-level processing helps prevent models from learning noise in the data.
- **Enhances Training Efficiency**: Reducing the number of features or augmenting data can speed up the training process and improve generalization.
- **Leverages Multiple Data Sources**: Multi-modal fusion allows models to combine different types of data, leading to more informed and accurate predictions.



## Chapter 3: Data Understanding

### Description

In this chapter, we focus on **data understanding**, which is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. Before applying models, it’s important to explore and gain insights into the dataset. This chapter provides methods and tools for analyzing the structure and relationships within your data, ensuring that the data is ready for modeling.

Key components of data understanding include **feature analysis**, **correlation studies**, and **distribution checks**, which help you identify patterns, relationships, and potential biases.

### Key Steps:
1. **Feature Distribution Over Classes**:
    - Analyze how features are distributed across different classes in the dataset. This helps identify imbalances or trends that may influence the model's learning process.
    
2. **Feature Correlation**:
    - Examine the relationships between features using correlation matrices. Understanding how features are related can help you eliminate redundant information and improve model efficiency.
    
3. **Feature Correlation by Regression**:
    - Apply regression techniques to investigate how features interact with the target variable. This can help you prioritize which features to focus on during the modeling process.
    
4. **Feature Importance**:
    - Utilize techniques such as **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** or **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to assess the importance of individual features. Feature importance provides insights into which features contribute the most to model predictions.
    
5. **Class Distribution Ratio**:
    - Check the distribution of class labels to ensure the dataset is balanced. Imbalanced data can cause bias in model predictions, so understanding class distribution is critical for fair modeling.
    
6. **PCA and t-SNE Feature Plots**:
    - Use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of data clustering and separability between classes.
    
7. **The Baseline and The Ground Truth**:
    - Establish a baseline model and compare the model’s predictions against the ground truth. This helps in evaluating the performance of the model and understanding the nature of prediction errors.

### Importance of Data Understanding:

- **Identifies Key Relationships**: By understanding correlations and interactions between features, you can make more informed decisions about which features to use for modeling.
- **Detects Data Imbalances**: Analyzing class distributions ensures that your model doesn’t become biased toward overrepresented classes.
- **Improves Interpretability**: Techniques like SHAP and LIME provide explanations for why a model makes certain predictions, improving the transparency of your machine learning models.
- **Visualizes Data Patterns**: PCA and t-SNE visualizations make it easier to see how well-separated your classes are and where the model might struggle.
